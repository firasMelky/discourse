module Chat
  # Service responsible for marking messages in a thread
  # as read. For now this just marks any mentions in the thread
  # as read and marks the entire thread as read.
  # As we add finer-grained user tracking state to threads it
  # will work in a similar way to Chat::UpdateUserLastRead.
  #
  # @example
  #  Chat::UpdateUserThreadLastRead.call(channel_id: 2, thread_id: 3, guardian: guardian)
  #
  class UpdateUserThreadLastRead
    include ::Service::Base

    # @!method call(channel_id:, thread_id:, guardian:)
    #   @param [Integer] channel_id
    #   @param [Integer] thread_id
    #   @param [Guardian] guardian
    #   @return [Service::Base::Context]
